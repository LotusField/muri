Simulation program for 3D heat and vapor static diffusion in orthogonal construction details in building science

## The program
### Goal
This program is design for architects and engineers to simulate static 3D diffusion of heat and vapor in construction details. The results allows one to check for the safety of the construction detail with regard to condensation and mould growth.
